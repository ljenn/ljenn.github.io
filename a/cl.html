						<p>My name is Jenny, and I want to be Azuki's Designer. <br/><br/>

						I resonate with Azuki’s skater brand because pursuing the nontraditional route has been core to my experiences. I'm a Bioinformatician turned designer, and I'll tell you why me.<br/><br/>

						<b>If I'm not the right fit for Azuki at this time, I would love if you took 5 minutes to give constructive feedback on my application. ☕️</b>

							<h4>1. Resilience in high pressure work environments</h4>
						<p><i>In college, I competed in a global synthetic biology competition where our team was sponsored with over $20,000+ funds by biotechnology companies. Our experiments failed, and we flew out to Boston to deliver a project with no results.</i><br/><i class="icon fa-flask"></i></p>
						</header>
						<p>
							As a freshman with no experience, I applied to a research team of veterans. In 4 months, we designed a research project, fundraised for money, executed experiments, and presented our results. It was a huge time investment: 50-60 workhours per week, sometimes spending over 20+ hours in the lab in a single day. The yearly retention rate was 7%, or one person. After our lack of results, I was the only person who stayed from my year.<br/><br/>
							I had a vision, and for the next 3 years, I co-founded and built <i>synbio.</i> from ground up - a synthetic biology project incubator. I was the youngest and most inexperienced in a room full of upperclassmen and Master's/PhD researchers, but I persevered in the face of my insecurities. I recruited new members who we mentored and eventually placed second worldwide out of over 400 teams. Member retention tripled and growth doubled. <i>synbio.</i> began as 'failures,' but when I graduated, we had accomplishments to our name.

								<h4>2. I wear lots of hats</h4>
								<p><i> Hoodies for coding. Caps for creativity. Snapbacks for style.<br/><i class="icon fa-headphones"></i></i>
							</header>
							<p>
								I love being involved with my community, and I've picked up useful skills for startups over the years:
								<ul>
									<li><b>Coding</b> - best at Python and Swift, self taught Html/Css/Js</li>
									<li><b>Creative flexibility</b> - problem solving at early-stage startups, optimizing internal structure, decade-long front-end hobbyist </li>
									<li><b>Self sufficient</b> - hitchhiked with police officers in Scotland; learned Spanish off my phone to board the bus and order food in Spain</li>
									<li><b>Tactful</b> - from when I bartended in Sweden</li>
									<li><b>Anticipating needs</b> - spent many years caring for family and volunteering in clinical settings</li>
									<li><s>Always snacky</s></li>

									<h4>3. Why design</h4>

								<p><i> When I considered a career in medicine, I imagined a company with no overhead work for providers, a tri-fusion system integrating medical, dental, and mental health, and a normalized culture of not having all the medical answers - transformed into a department for undiagnosed diseases.</i>
								<br/><i class="icon fa-object-group"></i></p>
							</header>
									<p>
									I love design because it lets me reimagine systems. Imagine a better electronic medical records system. Imagine an education system where feedback is the focus - instead of red marks on an exam, kids are given immediate corrective feedback while learning, which teaches them how to learn. Imagine a world where education is taught through life experiences and mixed learning styles, and subjects are made accessible to English Second Language speakers and those neurodivergent or underresourced. Imagine a world that celebrates culture, that advocates financial literacy and emotional health, and that leverages everyone's unique strengths. Those are all the things that I've been involved in, and the web3 space draws me in because it's a system that lets us reimagine systems.<br/><br/>


									I also love design because I love people, and that's why I volunteer. Sometimes, no matter how complex the root cause, the feeling of resonation is all anyone ever wants.

										<h4>4. My top strengths, as said by others</h4>
										<p>I asked eight former teammates, out of the blue with no context: <br/>What would you say are my four biggest strengths?<br/>
										They said -
										<br/><i class="icon fa-pie-chart"></i></p>
									</header>
										<blockquote>
											Creative, insightful/thoughtful/strategic, fast learner, selfstarter <br/>Not a lot of ppl are self starters <br/>
										Or a quick learner. But you’re really good at picking up new skills by yourself and being self sufficient
									</blockquote>

										<blockquote>
											Kindness (treat everyone with respect, regardless shape, size, sex, alien or not)<br/>
											Hardworking (you are willing to put 110% in something you believe in)<br/>
											Curiosity (eager to seek answers - day to day thing or scientific)<br/>
											Artistic (like it or not, you are filled with artistic traits - designing, organizing)
										</blockquote>

										<blockquote>
											Dedication is absolutely one of them<br/>
											Attention to detail<br/>
											Idk how to say "striving to do things right the first time" in one word<br/>
											I think you're resourceful<br/>
										</blockquote>

										 <blockquote>
											 Attention to detail, you can be very passionate about things you work on, constant improvement, self driven
										 </blockquote>
										 <blockquote>
											 Ambitious, communicative, detail-oriented, independent, open-minded, trustworthy
										 </blockquote>
										 <blockquote>
											 Creative, detail-oriented, empathetic, open-minded, curious, people-oriented
										 </blockquote>
										 <blockquote>
										 Collaborative - I think you shine the best when working together.<br/>
										 Artistic - Basically meaning that you have an eye for UI.<br/>
										 Articulate (Communication) - I think you can clearly express your thoughts to others.<br/>
										 Motivational - Once you have a clear goal, I think your positive mindset and focus heightens which leads you to be motivational.<br/>
										 </blockquote>

										 <blockquote>
 											Analyzing situation comprehensively, seeing things in different perspectives <br/>
 											Offering useful feedbacks to others <br/>
 											Encourage, support, comfort others. (Empathetic)<br/>
											Communicating ideas clearly<br/>
											Design!<br/>
											Understand Tik Tok (XD not sure if this counts, but I think this is an amazing skill that I can't learn)
 										 </blockquote>

										 <blockquote>
 											Patience Empathy Problem solving Resilience <br/>
 											Patience Empathy Courage Resilience <br/>
 											I’m bumping problem solving down. I mean it is one of your strengths but I think courage is top 4
 										 </blockquote>
