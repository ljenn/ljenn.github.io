              <br/>
              <p>
                Sensory processing is how we perceive the world through our five senses.
                For an autistic person, the way they perceive the world may be different
                from the neurotypical person.
                <br/><br/>
                Autistic people often experience hyper- or hypo- sensitivities, which
                affect the intensity in how they perceive their surroundings. Sometimes,
                an autistic person may experience a sensory overload, which is an overwhelming
                excess of sensory information. This can cause stress, anxiety, or physical pain,
                which might cause them to react in different ways, which could be through a meltdown,
                in which they don’t respond, or by behaviors that might injure themselves or others.
                <br/><br/>
              </p>
                <blockquote style="font-size:22px; font-style: italic; color: #777">
                  For example:<br/>
                  Somewhere in the world, someone is shopping at a grocery store. For the normal person,
                  the noise volume is acceptable and not uncomfortable. However, someone experiencing
                  hypersensitivity may hear louder noises that may overlap and overwhelm them. As for the
                  hyposensitive, it’s the opposite; they may hear less.
                </blockquote>
                <br/><br/>
              <p>
                This applies to visually overwhelming colors or brightness, uncomfortable tactile
                feel of clothing, or exaggerated flavors of foods. Some people may have a combination
                of hyper- and hypo- sensitivities, and they aren’t always active.

                        scented soaps and shampoos. They might try to keep things odorless by being clean and orderly.

                        are also a factor. Someone who is hypertactile isn’t necessarily affected by all types of touches.

                        It's possible that they might not feel light touches, pain, or temperature extremes.
                        Because of their lack of tactile feel, they might try to "touch/feel" via
                        banging their head, biting themselves, or wearing heavy clothes.

                        higher intensity, even walking at a normal pace could be an issue.

                      <td>
                        They might be able to swing or spin around without feeling dizzy and may have trouble staying still.
