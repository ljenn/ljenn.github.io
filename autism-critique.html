              <br/>
              <p>
                In high school, I remember one particular Saturday morning when I sat in a stuffy room
                listening to a girl in Speech & Debate present her original oratory speech. She talked
                about her autistic sibling, and her message was that her sibling wasn't "broken." There's
                a popular consensus that those who are characterized with the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
                are often associated a negative image. They're often misunderstood by neurotypical people
                and portrayed in inaccurate ways.
                <br/><br/>
                For example, as I scoured the Internet to research my topic, I came across an article that
                surmised an unproven correlation between ASD and terrorism: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4633128/Autistic-people-risk-radicalised.html">DailyMail article</a>
                <br/><br/>
                Articles like these, if not written
                in the proper angle, often cause stigmatization. It invokes fear and concern when there may
                not be a need for it. While I think it’s not entirely wrong to discuss a hypothesis, I think
                there are many ways they could have written the article differently:
                <br/><br/>
              </p>
                <ol style="font-size:22px">
                  <li>
                    <b><font color="#4a7">They should be clear and upfront about disclaimers.</font></b> There is one sentence that says,
                    “It is important to caution here that there is no substantial link between ASD and terrorism.”
                    Listed at the end of the article, the single sentence is easily forgotten when surrounded by
                    the rest of the article. This should be noted at the very beginning, and perhaps given more
                    than one sentence.
                  </li><br/>
                  <li>
                    <b><font color="#4a7">The article’s premises seem to be purely assumptions.</font></b> It would have been more
                    comprehensive to discuss other roots of terrorism, instead of solely pointing towards ASD.
                    They also only provide two correlations, which may or may not be statistically insignificant
                    compared to the terrorist population. The article certainly doesn’t provide enough evidence
                    to draw solid deductions from.
                  </li><br/>
                  <li>
                    <b><font color="#4a7">It displays a lack of understanding of the ASD spectrum.</font></b> The ASD spectrum is massive,
                    and while certain traits like hyper-focus are commonly associated with it, they fail to address
                    that the degree of each characterization can vary immensely among autistic people.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <br/><br/>
              <p>
                By pointing fingers and placing blame on a certain group of people, it’s easy to remove empathy and
                place an “outsider” label on them. While the article may not do so intentionally, it is important to
                acknowledge that as humans, we are all subjected to cognitive biases, and we don’t want to unintentionally
                dehumanize a group of people through our words.
                <br/><br/>
                At the end of the article, they list their information source, an article that is much more objective
                in conveying that: (1) this was what they were researching, (2) these are the details, and (3) the
                research is still in its infancy stages, so no conclusions can be drawn.
                <br/><br/>
                While this article is simply a more extreme example of how people with ASD can be stigmatized,
                it could be as simple as, subconsciously thinking less of someone because of their ASD characterization
                or victimizing them as hopeless and useless. Examples of those, and this article is included,
                commonly use a lot of pathos, elements that evoke emotion. It leads to pity, not empathy. Instead,
                using more logos, which is an appeal to logic, and more words with neutral connotations would provide
                a stronger, more objective platform to help neurotypical people understand those who are autistic.
                They’re just different individuals, not “broken” and as foreign as some may portray.
                <br/><br/>
                In contrast, a different article on the same subject is much more objectively written:
